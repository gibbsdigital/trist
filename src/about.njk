            <h3>Plan</h3>
            <p>
                Planning is essential to success in many things in life. I use many tools including: 
                <a href="#">Notion</a> a wonderful tool for managing everything from to-do lists, to 
                so on and so on. In this stage I go through a process of research using questions.
            </p>

            </div> -->

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>
                In this phase I use anything from a pencil and paper, all the way to a design program 
                such as <a href="">Figma</a>. It's important to layout a design before coding it up.
            </p>

            <h3>Develop</h3>
            <p>
                Some of my tools include <a href="">VS Code</a>, semantic HTML, CSS, JS, and even tools 
                such as the static site generator <a href="">Eleventy</a>.

            <p>
                I went to school for a traditional Computer Science degree where I
            gained experience with everything from low level assembly language to
            c++, and data structures and algorithms. I loved it so much I became an
            SI Instructor I eventually found myself drawn the most toward Web
            Development and Design.
